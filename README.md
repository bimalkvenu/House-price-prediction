The model is trained on a dataset (house_prices.csv) and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The application also features a user-friendly terminal interface where users can input their house preferences and receive a predicted price. Additionally, user preferences and predictions are saved automatically into a CSV file for future reference.
